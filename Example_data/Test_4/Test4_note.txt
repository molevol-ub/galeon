# --- Test 4 #
# Find gene clusters for GR (gustatory receptors) and IR (ionotropic receptors) gene families.
# Run Galeon with two g values: 100kb and 300kb

# Add evolutionary distance information for each family by aligning the proteins and computing the evolutionary distances between them using iqtree
